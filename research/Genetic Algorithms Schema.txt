https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(genetic_algorithms)

Schema = the way the chromosome is represented
- Binary chromosome = 100*01
- Wild cards = generics (so for binary chromosome, a wild card can be a 1 or a 0)
- The order of a schema is defined as the number of fixed positions in the template
  - So there needs to be some fixed positions in the chromosomes (you cannot have all wild cards)
- Defining length = the distance/length between the first and last fixed positions.

Length of schema
- defines the total number of nodes in a schema
- also equal to the number of nodes in the program matching schema

Disruption of schema
- when a parent matches a schema but its child does not match the schema

Propagation of schema
- when a schema is passed on from one generation to the next.

Expansion and compression of a schema
- what a schema requires
  - alphabet (all the characters, rules, etc, that a schema can use)
  - length of all words over the alphabet
  - what the wildcard can represent in the alphabet (maybe you only want the wild card to represent some numbers in the alphabet)
  - length of all wildcard words over the wildcard alphabet.
  - empty schema
