# Biocomputation Coursework

- We will be using Genetic Algorithms to classify some datasets.

- The type of Genetic Algorithms we will be using are Genetic Algorithms for Rule Set Production (GARP)

- For GARP, we will need to split the dataset (that we are working on) into TEST DATA and TRAINING DATA

- Fitness function = how close each individuals genes are to the training data's condition.

- Training = allow each member to learn if their condition is correct, but their output is not correct.
  - can be done by manually switching the value
  - can be done by giving a higher mutation rate just to the output part only.
