Introduction
- what is GA
- task asked
- approaches done

Background research
- what is evolutionary computing
- uses of EC in datamining
- lit review

Experimentation (ds1)
- task/data given
- how to formulate a geneotype
- describe basic GA
  - pseudo code
  - fitness function, selection (tornament), crossover (single point), mutation (bitswap/generics) --> basic version
- hyper parameters
  - generate graphs on hyper parameters given.
  - Present your results as averaged behaviour over more than one run
    - each line on graph = hyper parameter
    - each line = multiple averages of a run
- Reasoning in what happens when changing hyper parameter
- What was the schema you get

Experimentation (ds2)
- task/data given
- genotype formulated
- describe the more complex GA
  - pseudo code
  - fitness function (exponential/quadratic, bias), selection (fitness proportionate selection/roulette wheel), crossover (single point), mutation (same) --> more complex version
  - reasoning in more complex GA
- hyper parameters
  - generate graphs on hyper parameters given
  - Present your results as averaged behaviour over more than one run
    - each line on graph = different hyper parameters (diff color)
    - each line = multiple averages of a run
- Reasoning in what happens when changing hyper parameters
- What schema you get

Experimentation (ds3)
- task/data given
- genotype formulated, explination why
- describe GA
  - psuedocode
  - fitness function (exponential/quadratic, bias), selection (fitness proportionate selection/roulette wheel), crossover (single point vs blend), mutation (creep), sort and swap parts of each generations (to retain information from prev gen)
  - reasoning in more complex GA
- Hyper parameters
  - generate graphs on hyper parameters given
  - present your results as average behaviour over more than one run
    - each line on graph = different hyperparameters
    - each line = multiple averages of a run
- Reasoning in what happens whe changing hyperparameters
- What schema you get (this is hardish...)
